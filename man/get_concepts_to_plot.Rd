\title{Get Concepts in fcmconfr Object to Include in Plot}
\usage{
get_concepts_to_plot(fcmconfr_object, filter_limit = 1e-09)
}
\arguments{
\item{fcmconfr_object}{A direct output of the \code{\link{fcmconfr}} function}

\item{filter_limit}{Remove concepts whose inferences do not exceed this value}
}
\description{
This determines which concepts should be included in fcmconfr output plot by
selecting concepts that either were NOT clamped (if applicable) or did not
reach a certain activation level throughout the simulation (i.e. whose
0-value would take up space in the figure.)
}
\details{
This function removes:
    - Clamped Nodes because they would be held at 1 and would increase the
    x-axis, potentially diminishing the ability to view other data
    - Inactivated Nodes because they do not display on the plot and would
    add unnecessary whitespace to the plot.
}
