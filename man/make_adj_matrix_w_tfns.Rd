\title{Create Adj. Matrix w/ Edges Represented as TFNs}
\usage{
make_adj_matrix_w_tfns(lower = matrix(), mode = matrix(), upper = matrix())
}
\arguments{
\item{lower}{An n x n adjacency matrix that represents the lower limits of
edges in an FCM}

\item{mode}{An n x n adjacency matrix that represents the modes of edges in an FCM}

\item{upper}{An n x n adjacency matrix that represents the upper limits of
edges in an FCM}
}
\value{
An adj. matrix (of class 'tfn') with edges represented as TFNs
}
\description{
This constructs an adjacency matrix with edges represented by triangular
fuzzy numbers (TFNs) from an adjacency matrix of lower bounds, an adjacency
matrix of modes, and an adjacency matrix of upper bounds
}
\details{
The input adjacency matrices must square n x n matrices with the same dimensions.
The input can be either matrix, data.table, tibble, or data.table type objects,
but the output will always be a data.frame. This is for output readability.
data.table and tibble objects work logically, but their outputs require
additional steps to parse from the user's perspective.

If the input matrices have named columns, those names will be carried over
in the triangular adjacency matrix. Otherwise, generic node IDs will be used
(C1, C2, ... Cn).
