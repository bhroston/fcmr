\usage{
build_fgcmconfr_models(
  grey_adj_matrices,
  samples,
  aggregation_fun = c("mean", "median"),
  include_zeroes = FALSE,
  nodes,
  show_progress
)
}
\arguments{
\item{grey_adj_matrices}{A list of n x n adjacencey matrices representing fcms}

\item{samples}{The number of samples to draw with the selected sampling method. Also,
the number of sampled models to generate}

\item{nodes}{A vector of node names (IDs) present in every adjacency matrix}

\item{show_progress}{TRUE/FALSE Show progress bar when creating fmcm. Uses pbmapply
from the pbapply package as the underlying function.}

\item{sampling}{The sampling method to be applied. Must be one of the following: "nonparametric", "uniform", or "triangular"}

\item{parallel}{TRUE/FALSE Whether to utilize parallel processing}
}
\description{
This function generates n fgcm models whose edge weights are sampled from either
the defined edge values in a set of adjacency matrices or continuous (uniform or triangular)
parametric distributions derived from the sets of edge values, and stores them
as a list of adjacency matrices.
