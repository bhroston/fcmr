\usage{
build_conventional_fcmconfr_models(
  adj_matrices = list(matrix()),
  sampling = "nonparametric",
  samples = integer(),
  include_zeroes = TRUE,
  show_progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_matrices}{A list of n x n adjacencey matrices representing fcms}

\item{sampling}{The sampling method to be applied. Must be one of the following: "nonparametric", "uniform", or "triangular"}

\item{samples}{The number of samples to draw with the selected sampling method. Also,
the number of sampled models to generate}

\item{include_zeroes}{TRUE/FALSE Whether to incorporate zeroes as intentionally-defined
edge weights or ignore them in aggregation}

\item{show_progress}{TRUE/FALSE Show progress bar when creating fmcm. Uses pbmapply
from the pbapply package as the underlying function.}
}
\description{
This function generates n fcm models whose edge weights are sampled from either
the defined edge values in a set of adjacency matrices derived from the sets
of edge values, and stores them as a list of adjacency matrices.
