\title{Interval-Valued Fuzzy Number (IVFN) - S3 Class}
\usage{
ivfn(lower = double(), upper = double())
}
\arguments{
\item{lower}{An n x n adjacency matrix that represents the lower limits of
edges in an FCM}

\item{upper}{An n x n adjacency matrix that represents the upper limits of
edges in an FCM}
}
\value{
An interval-valued fuzzy number (IVFN)
}
\description{
This constructs an interval-valued fuzzy number (ivfn) that represents a
continuous, uniform distribution of values within a given range
}
\details{
The IVFN class does not perform any operations on its input, rather
it checks whether the input follows the defining criteria of IVFNs

For IVFNs, the lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound.
If the lower bound and upper bound are equal, the IVFN represents a "crisp"
numeric value.

\examples{
ivfn(lower = 0, upper = 1)
ivfn(-1, 1)
