## Overview

fcmconfr is a tool to evaluate sets of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to generate inferences that leverage uncertainty in individual FCMs and across the collective.

`fcmconfr()` is the package's primary function which takes a list of FCM adjacency matrices (or an individual adjacency matrix) and performs the following analyses:

-   Simulate Input FCMs

-   Generate an Aggregate FCM and Simulate the result

-   Generate Bulk Monte-Carlo FCMs and Simulate them

`fcmconfr_gui()` provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to help users identify the appropriate inputs for their preferred analyses and generally improve the overall user-experience in defining the many inputs required by the primary `fcmconfr()` function.

**fcmconfr aims to consolidate existing software and theory into a centralized package:** The landscape of software tools to analyse FCMs is diverse, with approaches and outputs varying across them. This is reflective of the decentralized nature of FCM theory as a whole which features an array of analysis methods, each having their strengths and weaknesses, without one in particular being consistently adopted throughout the literature.

**fcmconfr offers novel tools to analyze FCMs with edge weights that incorporate uncertainty:** One limitation of the conventional FCM approach is that it restricts edge weights to discrete values. Many extensions of the conventional approach have been introduced in the literature that allow edge weights to be represented as intervals, distributions, and a numerous other abstractions. fcmconfr offers novel tools that streamline access to two such extensions: one represents edge weights as Interval-Value Fuzzy Numbers (IVFNs, named here as IVFN-FCMs) and the other represents edge weights as Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs, named here as TFN-FCMs).

However, most remain untested, and their mathematical complexity leaves many largely inaccessible (citation).

Package to FCM packages across the R ([fcm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fcm/index.html "CRAN: fcm")) and Python ([PyFCM](https://github.com/payamaminpour/PyFCM.git)) ecosystems as well
