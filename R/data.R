#' sample_fcms
#'
#' An collection of FCM datasets based on stakeholder perceptions of rising
#' salinization of a local reservoir in a socio-ecological system. This
#' collection is separated into two sub-collections: one with larger FCMs that
#' incorporate over 40 nodes, and one with smaller, simpler FCMs that greatly
#' reduce the number of nodes (n = 7) per map. The sub-collection of smaller,
#' simplified FCMs is included to hasten testing.
#'
#' $simple_fcms: these FCMs are filtered versions of the larger FCMs which
#' only include the following nodes, Guidance.Docs.for.Salt.Management,
#' Public.Education.Programs, Salts.Added.during.Water.Treatment,
#' Salts.Added.by.Winter.Maintenance.Activities, Ecosystem.Health,
#' Public.Awareness.of.Reservoir.Salinization, and
#' Salinization.of.the.Reservoir. (Renamd, but based on nodes in larger FCMs)
#'  - $conventional_fcms: A list of smaller, simplified conventional FCMs
#'  - $ivfn_fcms: A list of smaller, simplified ivfn FCMs
#'  - $tfn_fcms: A list of smaller, simplified tfn FCMs
#' $large_fcms: these FCMs are large (n > 40) and will likely increase runtimes
#' but represent a more complete dataset
#'  - $conventional_fcms: A list of large conventional FCMs
#'  - $ivfn_fcms: A list of large ivfn FCMs
#'  - $tfn_fcms: A list of large tfn FCMs
#'
#' Given in Rippy et al, (In Review); Not all stakeholder FCMs used here.
