`fcmconfr` streamlines the process of conducting dynamic simulations
using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs). The package supports multiple FCM
types (conventional, Interval-Value Fuzzy Number (IVFN) and Triangular
Fuzzy Number (TFN)) and provides tools for model aggregation and the
propagation of uncertainty from individual FCMs through to the
aggregate.

`fcmconfr` includes a variety of supporting functions that make working
with FCMs easier, including functions for creating IVFN and TFN
adjacency matrices from standard .xlsx and .csv files, functions for
stramlining parameter selection to facilitate model convergence, and
functions for visualizing FCM networks and simulation outputs. The
package was developed with a strong focus on accessibility (ease-of-use)
and features both an interactive GUI and standard function commands.

## Installation

Users can install the development version of `fcmconfr` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bhroston/fcmconfr")
# Or
remotes::install_github("bhroston/fcmconfr")
```

## Example

A typical `fcmconfr` workflow includes the following four steps:

1.  Import FCMs

2.  Set simulation parameters using `fcmconfr_gui()`

3.  Run simulations using `fcmconfr()`

4.  Explore outputs using `get_inferences()` and `plot()`

See `vignette("fcmconfr", package = "fcmconfr")` for a detailed
description of each step.

### 1. Import FCMs

FCMs are matrix objects that can be imported into R using
`readxl::read_excel()` and `read.csv()`. The best approach for importing
an FCM into R depends on the type of FCM being imported.

See `vignette("Importing_FCMs", package = "fcmconfr")` for a detailed
guide on importing different FCM types, including conventional FCMs,
FCMs with edge weights represented as IVFNs (IVFN-FCMs), and FCMs with
edge weights represented as TFNs (TFN-FCMs).

### 2. Set Simulation Parameters using `fcmconfr_gui()`

`fcmconfr()` is the central function of the package and requires
specifying many parameters. To guide users through that process, the
package procides an easy to use GUI that can be accessed by
`fcmconfr_gui()`.

<div style="text-align: center;">

<img src="vignettes/images/cluster_1_fcmconfr_gui.png"
style="width:70.0%" />

</div>

Calling `fcmconfr_gui()` launches a Shiny app that lets users
interactively select parameters and outputs a corresponding call to
`fcmconfr()` that users can copy-and-paste to run in their own scripts.

A brief summary of each parameter within the `fcmconfr_gui()` is
provided in a glossary stored in a side tab within the GUI. The side tab
can be opened by clicking the arrow symbol in the top-right-hand-corner
of the GUI.

### 3. Run Simulations using `fcmconfr()`

To run `fcmconfr()`, execute the output script created by
\`fcmconfr_gui(). The following call uses an example FCM from the
`sample_fcms` data included in the package.

``` r
# This call to fcmconfr() was generated from fcmconfr_gui()!
# Store the output in a variable to explore it later
fcmconfr_obj <- fcmconfr(
    adj_matrices = sample_fcms$simple_fcms$conventional_fcms,
    # Aggregation and Monte Carlo Sampling
    agg_function = 'mean',
    num_mc_fcms = 1000,
    # Simulation
    initial_state_vector = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
    clamping_vector = c(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
    activation = 'rescale',
    squashing = 'sigmoid',
    lambda = 1,
    point_of_inference = 'final',
    max_iter = 100,
    min_error = 1e-05,
    # Inference Estimation (bootstrap)
    ci_centering_function = 'mean',
    confidence_interval = 0.95,
    num_ci_bootstraps = 1000,
    # Runtime Options
    show_progress = TRUE,
    parallel = TRUE,
    n_cores = 2,
    # Additional Options
    run_agg_calcs = TRUE,
    run_mc_calcs = TRUE,
    run_ci_calcs = TRUE,
    include_zeroes_in_sampling = FALSE,
    include_sims_in_output = FALSE
  )
```

### 4. Explore `fcmconfr()` Results

`fcmconfr()` generates a large object with many concepts, the most
important of which are simulation inferences (individual, aggregate,
Monte Carlo). Inferences indicate how much each node in an FCM is
influenced by a particular change or action. The `get_inferences()`
function gives users access to that data without having to interact with
the `fcmconfr()` object directly.

``` r
fcmconfr_inferences <- get_inferences(fcmconfr_obj)
```

A plot of all inferences can be generated using `plot()`. Documentation
for `plot()` can be accessed via `?plot.fcmconfr` (`?plot` *returns the
documentation for the Base R version of the function*).

``` r
plot(fcmconfr_obj)
```
